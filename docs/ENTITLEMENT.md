# The FamilyControls entitlement is the critical path

`com.apple.developer.family-controls` is gated by Apple. It requires written justification, takes
days-to-weeks, and **can be denied**. Request it before writing shield code, not after — it must
be granted for the main app **and each of the three extensions**:

- `ShieldConfigurationExtension`
- `ShieldActionExtension`
- `DeviceActivityMonitorExtension`

## Justification to submit

> NoScroll is an open-source digital-wellbeing app. At the user's own request it shields social
> media apps the user selects themselves, so that the user reaches a stripped-down version of the
> same service without short-form video feeds. All configuration is local to the device; there is
> no backend, no remote management, and no third party can change a user's settings. Source:
> <repo URL>.

Being open source helps — link the repository.

## Symptom when it is absent

Tapping **Grant Screen Time access** fails with:

> Couldn't communicate with a helper application.

That is `NSCocoaErrorDomain 4099` (`NSXPCConnectionInvalid`). It is not a bug in NoScroll: the
Family Controls daemon refuses to talk to a process that does not carry the entitlement, and the
XPC layer reports the refusal in those words. NoScroll now translates it rather than showing it
raw.

## Building with the entitlement

It is **off by default**, because wiring it unconditionally breaks code signing for anyone whose
Apple account does not have the capability — and an app that will not sign is worse than one whose
Shield tab is honest about being wrapper-only.

Once Apple has approved it for your App ID:

```bash
# command line
xcodebuild -project ios/NoScroll.xcodeproj -scheme NoScroll \
  CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS=NoScroll/NoScroll.entitlements

# or in Xcode: set CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS on the NoScroll target to
# NoScroll/NoScroll.entitlements
```

Everything else in the app works without it.

## If it is denied

The app degrades to wrapper-only. That is a supported state, not a crash:

- `ShieldController.authorization` becomes `.denied`.
- The promise changes from "blocked" to "a calmer way in", **in the copy, honestly**. Do not claim
  enforcement the build cannot deliver — that is both a lie to users and an App Review risk.
- Ship a documented manual path: Screen Time → App Limits, configured by the user.

Planning for this now makes a denial cost a week rather than a rewrite.

## Android equivalent

`BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` needs a Play Permission Declaration Form. The 28 Jan 2026 policy
tightening bans autonomous "initiate, plan, execute actions" uses but explicitly carves out:

> "deterministic, rule-based automation ... a static, human-defined script (for example, 'If
> Trigger X occurs, perform Action Y')"

Quote that sentence in the declaration. `ForegroundAppMonitor` is written to sit inside it: it
reads one field (the foreground package name), performs no action inside any other app, and
declares neither `canRetrieveWindowContent` nor `canPerformGestures`.
