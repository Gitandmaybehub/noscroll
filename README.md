# NoScroll

![NoScroll — the home screen, the setup screen, and Instagram with no Reels tab](docs/img/hero.jpg)

**Use Instagram and YouTube without short-form video.** Free, open source, no paywall, no ads,
no analytics.

NoScroll removes Reels, Shorts, Explore and algorithmically suggested content — and keeps the
parts you actually opened the app for: messages, the people you follow, and posting. When a
friend sends you a reel you can watch *that* video. You just can't scroll to the next one.

Eight services: **Instagram** and **YouTube** are probe-verified against the live sites;
**X, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat** and **Reddit** ship as beta and are labelled so in
the app.

> Status: **pre-release.** The engine, rule bundles, both native shells and the shield layers are
> written and tested, and both the iPhone and Android apps build and run. Not yet submitted to either store —
> see [What's not done](#whats-not-done).

## How it works

Two layers. The second is the one that matters.

**1. The wrapper.** NoScroll loads the platforms' own mobile websites in an embedded browser and
injects a small engine that hides or removes the endless surfaces. Your session cookies stay on
your device.

**2. The shield.** A wrapper on its own enforces nothing — you'd just open Safari. So NoScroll also
shields the real Instagram and YouTube apps at the OS level (iOS Screen Time / FamilyControls,
Android AccessibilityService), which makes the stripped version the way in rather than a
suggestion.

```
engine/    TypeScript → one IIFE. The entire blocking implementation.
rules/     Signed JSON rule bundles. Data, not code — updatable without an app release.
ios/       Swift. WKWebView shell + FamilyControls + three Screen Time extensions
           + a WidgetKit extension (home-screen shortcuts via noscroll://open/<service>).
android/   Kotlin. WebView shell + AccessibilityService.
probe/     Playwright smoke tests, run every 6h against live Instagram and YouTube.
tools/     Bundle signing, cross-language canonicalisation check, engine sync.
```

The engine is byte-identical on both platforms. Everything platform-specific stays in the shells.

### The app

First run is a narrative, not a checklist: how much you scroll → how old you are → **your life in
weeks**, with every band and the percentage derived from your two answers (at 18, scrolling 4.8h
of a 5h daily surplus, that is 96% of your remaining free time). Then the permissions, then out.

Home is one service at a time, with today's usage, that service's switches, and a five-tab shell —
Sleep, everything-blocked, Home, Shield, You. A WidgetKit extension puts the same services on your
home screen, opening through NoScroll via `noscroll://open/<service>`.

### Rules are data

Every competitor in this category hardcodes CSS selectors and patches them reactively, which is
why they visibly leak. NoScroll ships selectors as an **ed25519-signed JSON bundle** fetched at
runtime with a three-tier fallback — remote → cached → baked into the binary — so a cold first
launch with no network still blocks, and an upstream redesign is fixed in minutes instead of an
App Store review cycle.

Every rule declares `expectMin`. The engine counts what it actually matched and reports anomalies,
so a rotted selector raises an alert before a user notices.

**Rules are open to pull requests.** If Instagram changes something and NoScroll starts leaking,
you can fix it yourself — see [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md).

## Build

Use pnpm 9, or 10.5 or newer. pnpm 10 and 11 block dependency build scripts by
default; `engine/pnpm-workspace.yaml` pre-approves the one dependency that needs
one (esbuild, whose postinstall links its native binary). pnpm 10.4 and older
read that approval from a different place and will still print
`[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS]` — upgrade pnpm rather than working around it.

```bash
# Engine — 42 tests, no device needed
cd engine && pnpm install && pnpm test && pnpm build

# Sync the built engine + rules into both app targets
./tools/sync-engine.sh          # macOS / Linux / Git Bash
npm run sync-engine             # any OS, incl. Windows PowerShell / cmd.exe — no bash needed
# or directly:
node tools/sync-engine.mjs      # same script npm run sync-engine calls
tools/sync-engine.ps1           # native PowerShell equivalent (Windows)

# iOS — pure logic tests on the host, then the app itself
cd ios/NoScrollCore && swift test
open ios/NoScroll.xcodeproj      # pick your Apple ID under Signing, then Run

# Android — unit tests + a real APK
cd android && ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug

# Live probes against real Instagram and YouTube
cd probe && pnpm install && pnpm exec playwright install chromium && pnpm probe
```

Rule bundles are signed. To work on them you need your own keypair:

```bash
node tools/sign-bundle.mjs keygen           # writes keys/ (gitignored)
node tools/sign-bundle.mjs sign rules/*.json
swift tools/verify-canonical.swift          # Node and Swift must agree byte for byte
```

## Nothing is forced on

Every block is a switch you own. The core ones — Reels, Shorts, Explore,
suggested posts — arrive switched **on**, so a fresh install works with no
setup, and first-run onboarding shows you every switch once so nothing is a
surprise later. But you can turn any of them off, at any time, in Settings.

The product has an opinion. It doesn't take the choice away.

## The one rule that is not negotiable

```
The engine MUST NOT hide, remove, restyle, or observe any node on an auth surface.
```

Hard-coded in [`engine/src/authguard.ts`](engine/src/authguard.ts), not overridable by any rule
bundle, and enforced by a CI test that fails the build.

Two reasons. A hiding rule that swallows Instagram's own security interstitial bricks login with
no visible error. And Apple 5.1.1(vi) treats credential harvesting as *developer-program removal*
— refusing to look at a login page at all is what keeps NoScroll provably clear of it.

Verified against the real login page by the live probe, not just in a test DOM.

## Privacy

Two tiers, stated precisely, because vagueness here is what makes people call a wrapper a phishing
app:

1. **Platform session cookies never leave your device.** There is no backend, no proxy, and no
   server-side cache of anything you look at. The repo is public, so this is auditable rather than
   a promise.
2. **Rule-health telemetry is opt-in and anonymous.** It reports `{ruleId, expected, actual,
   bundleVersion}` — never a URL, never page content. See
   [`engine/src/bridge.ts`](engine/src/bridge.ts).

No analytics SDK. No ad pixel. No crash reporter carrying identifiers. No tracking on the website
or the legal pages.

## What's not done

Honestly, because a feature list that overpromises is the thing this project is reacting to:

- **Not submitted to either store.** The iOS `com.apple.developer.family-controls` entitlement is
  gated by Apple, takes days-to-weeks, and can be denied — see [docs/ENTITLEMENT.md](docs/ENTITLEMENT.md).
  It has to be granted before the shield layer can run on a device.
- **The three Screen Time extensions are not yet targets in the Xcode project.** The app target
  builds and runs today; the shield extensions are written and typecheck against the iOS SDK, but
  adding them as targets is blocked on the entitlement above, since they cannot run without it.
- **Android rule-bundle signature verification is not implemented.** iOS verifies; Android
  currently reads bundles from assets/cache without checking the signature. Do not ship without it.
- **No notifications.** WKWebView cannot receive web push, and shielding an app suppresses that
  app's own notifications too. This is a scoped-out non-goal, not a bug.
- **Screen Time is off by default even on a device.** The Family Controls entitlement is opt-in
  (`NOSCROLL_ENTITLEMENTS`) because wiring it unconditionally breaks signing for any account
  without Apple's approval. Without it, "Grant access" explains why rather than failing with
  Apple's `Couldn't communicate with a helper application`.
- **Screen Time does not work in the iOS Simulator at all.** The frameworks are non-functional
  there, so the permission prompt can never appear; the app says so rather than failing quietly.
  Testing that flow needs a real device *and* the entitlement below.
- **Six of the eight services are beta.** Instagram and YouTube are probe-verified against the
  live sites; X, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat and Reddit have researched rules that no
  probe has confirmed yet. The app labels them BETA rather than listing eight logos as if they
  were equal.
- **Per-app usage and the app picker need the entitlement.** Usage reads "—" instead of a number
  until a DeviceActivityReport extension can run.
- **Posting Reels, stories, DM media, calls** — not available on the mobile web, so not available
  here. Post Mode temporarily lifts the shield so you can post in the real app.
- **The logged-in probe is skipped** unless you supply `PROBE_IG_STATE`. Use a dedicated probe
  account, never a personal one.
